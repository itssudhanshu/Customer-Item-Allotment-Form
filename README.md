- Admin Panel(for the Company)  
- Customer Detail Form (for the shopkeeper)  
- Item Details Form (for the shopkeeper)  
- Item-Allotment Form (for the shopkeeper)  
- Invoice Form (for the user)  


The language used-  
- Back-end languages like php, python etc.  
- Front-end languages like Ajax, jQuery, JavaScript, Html, Css etc.  
- Database - phpMyAdmin, MySQL. 
- Software Used (Server) - Xampp(Windows), VS Code(IDE).
